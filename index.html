      <div id="about" class="tab-content">
      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I work within a public sector Digital, Data and Technology environment providing user and application support.
        My role focuses on reliable service delivery, security, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
        This site supports my End Point Assessment professional discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is structured around key KSB areas that are discussed during the EPA, with each tab containing
        evidence and reflection aligned to assessment criteria.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div id="culture" class="tab-content" style="display:none;">
        <h1>Organisational Culture</h1>
        <p>
          I work within a local authority Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) environment, where organisational culture
          is shaped by public accountability, governance, and the need to deliver reliable services to a diverse user base.
          This culture introduces clear constraints, such as strict change control, security policies, and compliance
          requirements, which are essential for maintaining trust and protecting public data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within these constraints, I am encouraged to be proactive and creative in how I improve services. Rather than
          focusing purely on activity-based measures such as ticket volume, I adopt an outcome-driven mindset. This means
          prioritising long-term service stability, reducing repeat incidents, and improving the overall user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I regularly collaborate with teams that operate under different cultural pressures, including infrastructure,
          applications, security, and external suppliers. I adapt my communication style to ensure shared understanding,
          particularly when balancing technical risk with business impact. This approach supports continuous improvement
          while maintaining a blameless and respectful working culture.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="ethics" class="tab-content" style="display:none;">
        <h1>Data Ethics</h1>
        <p>
          In my role, I regularly handle personal and sensitive information, including user account details, access
          permissions, and system logs. I understand my responsibility under UK GDPR and data protection legislation to
          ensure this data is processed lawfully, securely, and only for legitimate purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I apply the principle of least privilege by ensuring users only have access to the systems and data required
          for their role. I verify user identity before making access changes and challenge requests that appear excessive
          or unnecessary. When working in test or troubleshooting scenarios, I avoid using live data and instead use
          anonymised or dummy accounts wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to identify a potential data breach or security vulnerability, I would act immediately to contain the
          issue, preserve evidence, and escalate through the appropriate information security and management channels.
          This ensures risks are managed effectively and lessons learned are shared to prevent recurrence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="problem" class="tab-content" style="display:none;">
        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>
          Problem solving is a core part of my role within user and application support. I use structured approaches such
          as root cause analysis, the 5 Whys, and collaborative swarming to ensure issues are understood fully before
          implementing fixes. This helps prevent recurring incidents and reduces disruption to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frequently use whiteboarding techniques to map systems, workflows, authentication paths, and dependencies.
          Visualising problems allows me to engage other teams more effectively and ensures everyone has a shared
          understanding of where failures are occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following incidents, I contribute to blameless reviews that focus on process improvements rather than
          individual fault. By gaining consensus across teams on corrective actions, I help ensure improvements are
          implemented and embedded into standard working practices.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="tooling" class="tab-content" style="display:none;">
        <h1>Tooling & Technology</h1>
        <p>
          I support a range of tooling and technologies within a public sector environment, including both SaaS
          platforms such as Microsoft 365 and legacy on-premise systems. This requires an understanding of different
          support models, security responsibilities, and operational risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          When assessing or recommending tools, I consider factors beyond functionality, including vendor support,
          documentation quality, security posture, cost, and long-term sustainability. This helps avoid adopting tools
          that introduce unnecessary technical debt or support challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also leverage automation and scripting where appropriate to improve efficiency and reduce manual error.
          Any tooling decisions I support are aligned with organisational standards and the wider digital strategy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="cld" class="tab-content" style="display:none;">
        <h1>Continuous Learning & Development</h1>
        <p>
          I actively engage in continuous professional development to ensure my skills remain relevant and effective.
          This includes learning PowerShell for automation, developing knowledge of Microsoft 365 administration,
          and strengthening my understanding of cyber security fundamentals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I regularly identify gaps in my knowledge through reflection on incidents and feedback from colleagues. I
          address these gaps through self-study, guided learning, and practical application within my role.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also support the development of others by sharing knowledge through walkthroughs, documentation, and
          informal knowledge-sharing sessions. This ensures my learning has a positive and measurable impact on
          team capability and service delivery.
        </p>
